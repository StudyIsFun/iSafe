## Why?
- New People have no idea about new places.They can be the victim of any mishappening.
- We will let them know unsafe area near them.Unsafe routes from source to destination.
- Unknowingly if they are in unsafe area,they can take many precautions like SOS to nearby police station and prime contacts,They can share live location,live mic and cam with their prime contacts.

## What you'll get
- You can send SOS in emergency case 
- You can check unsafe area near you (SS with dummy data) 
- You can see safe and unsafe path from source to destination
